      3. **To those who have submitted their information, you'll be granted a one activity point, which is 20 points, for your participation in this submission.**

2. Choose your own dataset **ONLY** from these great resources:

   - [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
   - [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
   - [Datahub.io](https://datahub.io/)

3. Each group must choose a **unique dataset**. **Duplicate** datasets **will not be accepted** and will result in a **failing grade for both submissions**.
   - ❗**NOTE**: Projects within this organization aren't not allowed to be used as your final examination output.

## Process
The following processes are essential components of your project and will be evaluated accordingly. Please ensure that each process is included to receive the corresponding points.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - 5%
   > Dataset URL must be included, it is where you've downloaded the dataset. So we can verify if the dataset is from the provided resources.
   >
   > Uploading the dataset from the provided resources to the other sources is not allowed, and it will make your project invalid. **ITS CHEATING!**
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing - 5%
3. Data Visualization - 10%
4. Model Development - 10%
   > Use at least **four (4) algorithms**.
5. Model Evaluation - 10%
   > Model's performance must at least be **85%**.
6. Documentation - 60%

   > *Question, why does documentation have the highest weight? Documentation is a crucial part of the project. It is where you can showcase your understanding of the project, the dataset, the model, and the results. It is where you can explain your findings and insights from the analysis. It is where you can demonstrate your ability to communicate your work effectively.*

   ❗ **NOTE**: Every section must be indicated in your final output to receive the corresponding points. *(refer to the image below for guidance.)*

## Submission

1. Create a `README.md` file that contains the following sections:
   - Title
   - Dataset Description
   - Summary of Findings
   - Data Preprocessing
   - Exploratory Data Analysis
  
      > Visualization (each visualization must have a corresponding interpretation)
   - Model Development
   - Model Evaluation (each model must have its own evaluation)
   - Conclusion
   - Contributors
  
   Example of a `README.md` file, refer to this [link](/examples/README.md). You may use this as a template for your final output's documentation or `README.md`.

   ❗ **NOTE**: This `README.md` file must be inside the root directory of your project folder.

2. Upload your project to your personal GitHub account. Make sure that your project is in **public** visibility.

   > We cannot fork and review your project if it is in private visibility.

3. Submit the GitHub link of your project to this link, [forms.gle](https://forms.gle/hdQpw3TmXUHQFyBu7), together with your group members' information.

   > *Questions, why do we need to submit a GitHub link? To ensure that you have followed the instructions and have submitted your project on time. After, we will fork the main branch of your project to review your final output and we will showcase your project in our organization's repository.*
